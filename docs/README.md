## **IMPORTANT UPDATE**

On the 20th of August 2022, Martin surprisingly released a new version of this documentation. While this fork will try to incorporate the changes, one important footnote that got added is the following:

> I am homeless in [Hamburg](https://problemkaputt.de/homeless.htm), please help me out!

The authors of this fork thought that this deserves more than a footnote, hence this notice here.

## This is the source files for https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/

This is a conversion/edition of Martin "nocash" Korth's Playstation specs document originally hosted at https://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm

Martin is a difficult individual to reach (see https://problemkaputt.de/email.htm, especially the part about gmail), and so far, any attempt at contacting him about collaborating on this document failed.

Therefore, no copyright or license have been properly acquired to republish and alter this document. However, since this repository will accept and proceed to issue corrections, amendments, and additions to the original work, the [fair use and derivative work doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work) is believed to be applicable in this case.

An important detail to know about this current document, as well as the original from Martin, is that it isn't a clean room reverse engineering project, as some people may seem to believe or repeat. A good chunk of the original document has been either directly copy/pasted from the confidential code and documentation from Sony, or summarized and rephrased. As this document isn't clean room, any work derived from it shouldn't be considered clean, and anyone saying otherwise is misguided at best. The referenced source material, code and documentation, can be found at https://psx.arthus.net/sdk/Psy-Q/

The readable index is available at https://github.com/psx-spx/psx-spx.github.io/blob/master/docs/index.md or https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/ for easy browsing.

To discuss the contents of this document, or hang out with like-minded people on development, hacking, and reverse engineering of Sony's first console, feel free to [join the PSX.Dev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/QByKPpH).

The initial conversion has been done using a custom awk script available here: https://github.com/psx-spx/psx-spx.github.io/tree/master/conversion, and the resulting files have been imported in the initial import commit. The list of revisions, corrections, and additions shall be available for historical purposes in the [github commit history](https://github.com/psx-spx/psx-spx.github.io/commits/master).
