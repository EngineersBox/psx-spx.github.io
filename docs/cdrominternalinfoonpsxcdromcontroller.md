#   CDROM Internal Info on PSX CDROM Controller
PSX software can access the CDROM via Port 1F801800h..1F801803h (as described
in the previous chapters). The following chapters describe the inner workings
of the PSX CDROM controller - this information is here for curiosity only -
normally PSX software cannot gain control of those lower-level stuff (although
some low level registers can be manipulated via Test commands, but that will
usually conflict with normal operation).<br/>

#### Motorola MC68HC05 (8bit single-chip CPU)
The Playstation CDROM drive is controlled by a MC68HC05 8bit CPU with on-chip
I/O ports and on-chip BIOS ROM. There is no way to reprogram that BIOS, nor to
tweak it to execute custom code in RAM.<br/>

[CDROM Internal HC05 Motorola Selftest Mode](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-hc05-motorola-selftest-mode)<br/>
The PSX can read HC05 I/O Ports and RAM via Test Commands:<br/>
[CDROM - Test Commands - Read HC05 SUB-CPU RAM and I/O Ports](cdromdrive.md#cdrom-test-commands-read-hc05-sub-cpu-ram-and-io-ports)<br/>

#### Decoder/FIFO (CXD1199BQ or CXD1815Q)
This chip handles error correction and ADPCM decoding, and acts as some sort of
FIFO interface between main/sub CPUs and incoming cdrom sector data. On the
MIPS Main CPU it is controlled via Port 1F801800h..1F801803h.<br/>
[CDROM Controller I/O Ports](cdromdrive.md#cdrom-controller-io-ports)<br/>
On the HC05 Sub CPU it is controlled via Port A (data in/out), Port E
(address/index), and Port D (read/write/select signals); the HC05 doesn't have
external address/data bus, so one must manually access the CXD1815Q via those
ports.<br/>

[CDROM Internal CXD1815Q Sub-CPU Misc Registers](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-cxd1815q-sub-cpu-misc-registers)<br/>
The PSX can read/write the Decoder I/O Ports and SRAM via Test commands:<br/>
[CDROM - Test Commands - Read/Write Decoder RAM and I/O Ports](cdromdrive.md#cdrom-test-commands-readwrite-decoder-ram-and-io-ports)<br/>
The sector buffer used in the PSX is 32Kx8 SRAM. Old PU-7 boards are using
CXD1199BQ chips, later boards are using CXD1815Q, and even later boards have
the stuff intergrated in the SPU. Note: The CXD1199BQ/CXD1815Q are about 99%
same as described in CXD1199AQ datasheet.<br/>

#### Signal Processor and Servo Amplifier
Older PSX mainboards are using two separate chips:<br/>
[CDROM Internal Commands CX(0x..3x) - CXA1782BR Servo Amplifier](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-commands-cx0x3x-cxa1782br-servo-amplifier)<br/>
[CDROM Internal Commands CX(4x..Ex) - CXD2510Q Signal Processor](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-commands-cx4xex-cxd2510q-signal-processor)<br/>
Later PSX mainboards have the above intergrated in a single chip, with some
extended features:<br/>
[CDROM Internal Commands CX(0x..Ex) - CXD2545Q Servo/Signal Combo](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-commands-cx0xex-cxd2545q-servosignal-combo)<br/>
Later version is CXD1817R (Servo/Signal/Decoder Combo).<br/>
Even later PSX mainboards have it integrated in the Sound Chip: CXD2938Q
(SPU+CDROM) with some changed bits and New SCEx transfer:<br/>
[CDROM Internal Commands CX(0x..Ex) - CXD2938Q Servo/Signal/SPU Combo](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-commands-cx0xex-cxd2938q-servosignalspu-combo)<br/>
Finally, PM-41(2) boards are using a CXD2941R chip (SPU+CDROM+SPU\_RAM), unknown
if/how far the CDROM part of that chip differs from CXD2938Q.<br/>

[CDROM Internal Commands CX(xx) - Summary of Used CX(xx) Commands](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-commands-cxxx-summary-of-used-cxxx-commands)<br/>
The PSX can manipulate the CX(..) registers via some test commands:<br/>

MUL isn't supported in original "M146805 CMOS" family (MUL is used/supported in
PSX cdrom controller).<br/>

#### Registers
```
  A   8bit  accumulator
  X   8bit  index register
  SP  6bit  stack pointer (range 00C0h..00FFh)
  PC  16bit program pointer (range 0000h..FFFFh)
  CCR 5bit  condition code register (flags) (111HINZC)
```

#### Pushed on IRQ are:
```
  SP.highest PC.lo
             PC.hi
             X
             A
  SP.lowest  Flags (CCR, 5bit condition code register) (111HINZC)
```

#### Addressing Modes
```
  nn       immediate             ;00h..FFh
  [nn]     direct address        ;[0000h..00FFh]
  [nnmm]   extended address      ;[0000h..FFFFh]
  [X]      indexed, no offset    ;[0000h..00FFh]

  dd       relative              ;$+2..3+(-80h..+7Fh)
```
Notes:<br/>
```
  operand "X+nn" performs an unsigned addition, and can address 0000h..01FEh.
  16bit operands (nnmm) are encoded in BIG-ENDIAN format (same for pushed PC).
```

#### Exception Vectors
Exception vectors are 16bit BIG-ENDIAN values at FFF0h-FFFFh (or at FFE0h-FFEFh
when running in Motorola Bootstrap mode).<br/>
```
  Vector Prio Usage
  FFF0h  7=lo TBI Vector (Timebase)
  FFF2h  6    SSPI Vector (SPI bus)     (SPI1 and SPI2)
  FFF4h  5    Timer 2 Interrupt Vector  (Timer 2 Input/Compare)
  FFF6h  4    Timer 1 Interrupt Vector  (Timer 1 Input/Compare/Overflow)
  FFF8h  3    KWI Vector (Key Wakeup)   (KWI0..7 pins)
  FFFAh  2    External Interrupt Vector (/IRQ1 and /IRQ2 pins)
  FFFCh  none Software Interrupt Vector (SWI opcode)            ;\regardless of
  FFFEh  1=hi Reset Vector              (/RESET signal and COP) ;/CPU's "I"

==== Reserved ====<br/>

#### HC05 Port 3Fh - Unknown/Unused
Reading this port via Sony's test command returns 20h (same as openbus), but
reading it via Motorola's selftest function returns 00h (unlike openbus), so it
seems to have some unknown/undocumented function; bit5 might indicate selftest
mode, or it might reflect initialization of whatever other ports.<br/>

#### HC05 Port OPTM=0:06h..07h,0Dh..0Fh - Reserved
#### HC05 Port OPTM=1:01h,06h..07h,0Ch..0Dh - Reserved
#### HC05 Port 20h..3Dh - Reserved
These ports are unused/reserved. Trying to read them on a PSone does return 20h
(possibly the prefetched next opcode value from the RAM test command). Other
HC05 variants contain some extra features in these ports:<br/>
[CDROM Internal HC05 On-Chip I/O Ports - Extras](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-hc05-on-chip-io-ports-extras)<br/>
The PSX CDROM BIOS doesn't use any of these ports - execpt, it is writing
[20h]=2Eh (possibly to disable unused LCD hardware; which might be actually
present in the huge 80pin HC05 chips on old PU-7 mainboards).<br/>

#### HC05 Openbus
Openbus values can be read from invalid memory locations, on PSX with 52pin
chips:<br/>
```
  I/O bank 0:    0:06h..07h, 0:0Dh..0Fh
  I/O bank 1:    1:01h, 1:06h..07h, 1:0Ch..0Dh, and upper 4bit of 1:05h
  Unbanked I/O:  20h..3Dh
  Unused Memory: 0240h..0FFFh, 5000h..FDFFh
```
The returned openbus value depends on the opcode's memory operand:<br/>
```
  [nn],[mmnn],[nn+x],[mmnn+x] --> returns LAST byte of current opcode (=nn)
  [x]                         --> returns FIRST byte of following opcode
```

#### Other HC05 I/O Ports
```
  SPI 1   - used for receiving SUBQ (via Port C)

  Timer 1 - unused
  Timer 2 - generates 1000Hz interrupts (for 250 baud "SCEx" string transfers)
  DDRx    - data directions for Port A-F (as listed above)
```
Note: The PSX has the HC05 clocked via 4.00MHz oscillator (older boards), or
via 4.3MHz signal from SPU (newer boards); internally, the HC05 is clocked at
half of those frequencies (ie. around 2 MHz).<br/>



##   CDROM Internal HC05 Motorola Selftest Mode
#### 52-pin HC05 chips (newer psx cdrom controllers)
52-pin chips are used on LATE-PU-8 boards, and on later boards ranging from
PU-18 up to PM-41(2).<br/>
[CDROM Internal HC05 Motorola Selftest Mode (52pin chips)](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-hc05-motorola-selftest-mode-52pin-chips)<br/>

#### 80-pin HC05 chips (older psx cdrom controllers)
80-pin chips are used PU-7, EARLY-PU-8, and PU-9 boards.<br/>
[CDROM Internal HC05 Motorola Selftest Mode (80pin chips)](cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller.md#cdrom-internal-hc05-motorola-selftest-mode-80pin-chips)<br/>

#### 32-pin HC05 chips (joypad/mouse)
Sony's Digital Joypad and Mouse are using 32pin chips (with TQFP-32 package),
which are probably containing Motorola HC05 CPUs, too. Unknown if/how those
chips can be switched into bootstrap/dumping modes.<br/>

#### Pinouts
[Pinouts - HC05 Pinouts](pinouts.md#pinouts-hc05-pinouts)<br/>



##   CDROM Internal HC05 Motorola Selftest Mode (52pin chips)
#### Motorola Bootstrap ROM
The Motorola MC68HC05 chips are including a small bootstrap ROM which gets
activated upon /RESET when having two pins strapped to following levels:<br/>
```
  Pin30 PortC.6 (/IRQ2) (/XINT) ----> wire to 3.5V (VCC)
  Pin31 PortC.7 (/IRQ1) (SCOR)  ----> wire to 7V (2xVCC)
```
Moreover, two pins are needed on /RESET for selecting a specific test mode:<br/>
```
  Pin16 PortB.0 ----> ModeSelectBit0 (0=GND, 1=3.5V)
  Pin17 PortB.1 ----> ModeSelectBit1 (0=GND, 1=3.5V)
```
The selectable four modes are:<br/>
```
  Mode0: Jump to RAM Address 0040h (useless when RAM is empty)
  Mode1: Semifunctional Selftest (useless)
  Mode2: Upload 200h bytes to RAM & jump to 0040h (allows fast/custom dumping)
  Mode3: Download ROM as ASCII hexdump (nice, but very slow)
```
The upload/download functions are using following additional pins:<br/>
```
  Pin50 PortF.0 ----> TX output (11bytes: 0Dh,0Ah," AAAA DD ")
  Pin51 PortF.1 <---- RX input  (1byte: "!" to request next 11 bytes)
  Pin52 PortF.2 ----> RTS output or so (not needed)
  Pin1  PortF.3 ----> DTR output or so (not needed)
  Ground ------------ GND for RX/TX
```
RX/TX are RS232-like serial signals (but using other voltages, 0=0V and
1=3.5V). Transfer format is 8-N-1, ie. one startbit(0), 8 databits LSB first,
no parity, one stopbit(1). Baudrate is OSC/2/208 (ie. 9616 bps for 4.000MHz, or
10176 bps for 4.2336MHz clock derived from CXD2545Q/CXD2938Q).<br/>
Note: Above pins may vary on some chips (namely on chips that don't have
PortF). The pins for entering bootstrap mode (PortC in this case) should be
described in datasheets; but transfer protocol and mode selection (PortB) and
transmission (PortF) aren't officially documented.<br/>

#### Mode2: Upload 200h bytes to RAM & jump to 0040h
This mode is very simple and powerful: After /RESET, you send 200h bytes to the
RX input (without any response on TX output), the bytes are stored at
0040h..023Fh in RAM, and the chip jumps to 0040h after transferring the last
byte. The uploaded program can contain a custum highspeed dumping function, or
perform hardware tests, etc. A custom dumping function for PSX/PSone can be
found at:<br/>
```
  http://www.psxdev.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=557
```
After uploading the 200h-byte dumping function it will respond by send 4540h
bytes (containing some ASCII string, the 16.5Kbyte ROM image, plus dumps for
RAM and (banked) I/O port region, plus openbus tests for unused memory and I/O
regions.<br/>

Good places to pick 3.5V and 7.5V from nice solder pads are:<br/>
```
  CN602.Pin1  = 7.5V     ;\on PSX boards (with either 5pin or
  CN602.Pin3  = 3.5V     ;/               7pin CN602 connectors)
  IC601.Pin1  = 7.5V     ;-on PSone boards (3pin 78M05 voltage regulator)
  IC102.Pin32 = 3.5V     ;-on PSone boards (32pin Main BIOS ROM chip)
```
The SCOR trace on Pin31, connects to Signal Processor...<br/>
```
  CXD2510Q.Pin63  (eg. on PU-8 boards)   ;\
  CXD2545Q.Pin74  (eg. on PU-18 boards)  ; either one of these, depending
  CXD1817R.Pin49  (eg. on PU-20 boards)  ; on which chipset you have
  CXD2938Q.Pin77  (eg. on PM-41 boards)  ;
  CXD2941R.Pin85  (eg. PM-41(2) boards)  ;/
```
cut that trace (preferably on the PCB between two vias or test points, so you
can later repair it easily) (better don't try to lift Pin31, it breaks off
easily)<br/>
Note: Mode2 also requires Pin16=Low, and Pin30=High (but PSX/PSone boards
should have those pins at that voltages anyways).<br/>

#### Mode3: Download ROM as ASCII hexdump
This mode is very slow and not too powerful. But it may useful if you can't get
Mode2 working for whatever reason. Wiring for Mode3 is same as above, plus
PortB.0=3.5V. In this mode, the chip will send one 0Dh,0Ah," AAAA DD " string
immediately after /RESET (with 16bit address "AAAA" (initially 1000h), and 8bit
data "DD"). Thereafter the chip will wait for incoming commands:<br/>
```
  4-digit ASCII HEX address --> change address, and return 0Dh,0Ah," AAAA DD "
  chr(00h) --> increment address, and return 0Dh,0Ah," AAAA DD "
  chr(07h) --> jump to current address (not so useful)
  other characters --> same as chr(00h)
  All digits/characters sent to RX input will produce an echo on TX output.
```
Basic setup would be wiring RX to GND (the chip will treat that as infinite
stream of start bits with chr(00h), so it will respond by sending data from
increasing addresses automatically; the increment wraps from 4FFFh to FE00h
(skipping the gap between Main ROM and Bootstrap ROM), and also wraps from
FFFFh to 0000h; transfer is ultraslow: 13 characters needed per dumped byte:
chr(00h) to chip, chr(00h) echo from chip, and 0Dh,0Ah," AAAA DD " from chip.<br/>

Credits to TriMesh for finding the 80pin chip's bootstrap signals.<br/>

#### Other 80pin chips
DTL-H100x uses 80pin chip with onchip PROM (chip text "(M) MC68HC705L15",
instead of "Sony [...] 4246xx"), wiring for serial dumping on that is unknown
(the bootstrap ROM may be a little different because it should contain PROM
burning functions). PU-9 boards boards seem to use a similar PROM (with some
sticker on it).<br/>
DTL-H2000 uses 80pin CXP82300 chip with socketed piggyback 32pin EPROM - that
chip is a Sony SPC700 CPU, not a Motorola HC05 CPU. Accordingly there's no
Motorola Bootstrap mode in it, but of course one can simply dump the EPROM with
standard eprom utilities, as done by TriMesh).<br/>

Error flags for current sector are probably stored straight in this register
(ie. these flags are probably available even without using 9bit SRAM).<br/>
Or maybe not... if the chip supports receiving newer sectors during
time-consuming error corrections... then those newer would need to be stored in
SRAM, and would thus require 9bit SRAM for the error flags?<br/>

          repeat correction mode
      (2) Value of the raw data from the drive in the monitor-only
          or write-only mode
    The CMOME? and CMODE bits (bits 1, 0) of ECCSTS indicate the FORM and MODE
    of the sector the decoder has discriminated by the raw data from the drive.
    Due to erroneous correction, the values of these bits may be at variance
    with those of the HDR register MODE byte and SHDR register submode byte
    bit5.
```

Unknown when 1st..4th read indices are reset for HDR and SHDR (maybe on access
to certain I/O ports, or maybe anytime when receiving a new sector), also
unknown what happens on 5th read and up.<br/>

```
Indicates the start address of the most recently decoded sector (called "Minute
Address" because it points to the MM byte of the MM:SS:FF:MODE sector header).
Normally, CMADR should be forwarded to Host:<br/>
```
  HADR = (CMADR AND 7Fh)*400h+offset
  HXFR = length OR 4000h
```
Whereas, offset would be usually 00h, 04h, or 0Ch (to start reading from the
begin of the sector, or to skip 4-byte MODE1 header, or 12-byte MODE2 header).
And length would be usually 800h (normal data sector), or 924h (entire sector,
excluding the leading 12 sync-bytes). Length bit14 is undocumented/reserved,
but the PSX CDROM BIOS does set that bit for whatever reason.<br/>

"This counter keeps the addresses which write or read the data with host

When data from the host is written into the buffer or data to the host is read
from the buffer, the HADRC value is output from MA0 to 16. HADRC is incremented
each time one byte of data from the drive is read from the buffer (BFRD is
high) or written into the buffer (BFWR is high)."<br/>

#### Note
When reading from SRAM, data seems to go through a 8-byte data fifo, the HXFRC
(remain) and HADRC (addr) values aren't aware of that FIFO (ie. if there's data
in the fifo, then addr will be 8 bigger and remain 8 smaller than what has
arrived at the host).<br/>

#### Unclear Notes
"If sound map data is to be transferred before the data is transferred
(immediately after the host has set the BFRD and BFWR bits (bits 7 and 6) of
the HCHPCTL register high)":<br/>
```
  900h is loaded into HXFRC
  and 600Ch, 6A0Ch, or 740Ch is loaded into HADRC
  (at least, supposedly, above addresses , for cases when using 32K SRAM)
```
"At any other time":<br/>
```
  HADR and HXFR are loaded into HADRC and HXFRC
```
Unknown what the above crap is trying to say exactly.<br/>
"At any other time" does apparently refer to cases when transfers get started
(whilst during transfer, the address/remain values are obviously
increasing/decreasing).<br/>
For sound map, theoretically, the SMEN bit should be set, but above does
somewhat suggest that BFRD or BFWR (or actually: both BFRD and BFWR) need to be
set...?<br/>

```
For Focus Search: Keep FS1=on, and toggle FS2 on and off (this will generate a
waveform, and SENS will indicate when reaching a good focus voltage).<br/>

#### CXA1782BR - CX(1x) - Tracking/Brake/Sled - "DEFECT" at SENS pin
```
  23-20 4bit  Command (01h)

```
Note: The PSX CDROM BIOS does use the "Undoc" setting (ie. bit17=1), but the
effect is undoc/unknown?<br/>
Note: CX(1x) works different on CXD2545Q (some bits are moved around, and the
"SledKickHeight" bits are renamed to "SledKickLevel" and moved to different/new
CX(3X) commands.<br/>

#### CXA1782BR - CX(2x) - Tracking and Sled Servo Control - "TZC" at SENS pin

#### Note
The Servo Amplifier isn't directly connected to the CPU. Instead, it's
connected as a slave device to the Signal Processor. There are two ways to
access the Servo Amplifier:<br/>
1) The CPU can send CX(0X..3X) commands to the Signal Processor (which will
then forward them to the Servo Amplifier).<br/>
2) The Signal Processor can send CX(0X..3X) commands to the Servo Amplifier
(this happens during CX(4xxx) Auto Sequence command).<br/>

##   CDROM Internal Commands CX(0x..Ex) - CXD2938Q Servo/Signal/SPU Combo
Most commands are same as on CXD2545Q. New/changed commands are:<br/>

#### CXD2938Q - CX(349xxxxx) - New SCEx
Older PSX consoles have received the "SCEx" string at 250 baud via HC05
PortB.bit1, which allowed modchips to injected faked "SCEx" signals to that
pin. To prevent that, the CXD2938Q contains some new 32bit commands that allow
to receive somewhat encrypted "SCEx" strings via SPI bus. The used commands
are:<br/>
```
  CX(34910000) NewScexStopReading
  CX(3491xy80) NewScexRandomKey(xy)
  CX(34920000) NewScexFlushResyncOrSo
  CX(34944A00) NewScexInitValue1
  CX(3498C000) NewScexInitValue2
  CX(349C1000) NewScexThis   ;\inverse  ;\use CX(3C2080) for COUT selection
  CX(349D1000) NewScexThat   ;/of COUT  ;/
```
The relevant command is NewScexRandomKey(xy) which does send a random value
(x=01h..0Fh, and y=01h), and does then receive a 12-byte response via SPI bus
(which is normally used to receive SUB-Q data).<br/>
```
  1st byte: Unknown/unused (normally ADR/Control) ;\these should be probably
  2nd byte: Unknown/unused (normally Track)       ; set to some invalid values
  3rd byte: Unknown/unused (normally Index/Point) ;/to avoid SUB-Q confusion
  4th..10th byte: SCEx data or Dummy bytes (depending on xy.bit7..1)
  11th..12th byte: Unknown/unused (normally Audio Peak level)
```
The 12-byte packet does contain one SCEx character encoded in 4th..10th byte
corresponding to Flags in "xy" bit 7..1 (in that order):<br/>
All bytes with Flag=1 are ORed together to compute a Character byte (those
bytes could be all set to 53h for "S", or if more than one flag is set, it
could be theoretically split to something like 41h and 12h).<br/>
All bytes with Flag=0 are ORed together to compute a Dummy byte. If the
Character byte is same as the Dummy byte, then it gets destroyed by setting
Character=00h (to avoid that, one could set all dummies to 00h, or set one or
more dummies to FFh, for example).<br/>
Finally, "xy" bit0=0 indicates that the resulting character byte is inverted
(XORed by FFh), however, the CDROM BIOS does always use bit0=1, so the
inversion feature is never used.<br/>
For the whole SCEx string, there must be at least one 00h byte inserted between
each character (or some Char=Dummy mismatch, which results in Char=00h either),
and there should be a few more 00h bytes preceeding the first character ("S").<br/>
Note: Modchips didn't bother to reproduce that new SCEx transfers, instead they
have simply bypassed it by injecting the 250 baud SCEx string to some analog
lower level signal.<br/>

#### CXD2938Q - CX(3Bxxxx) - Some Changed Bits
Same as in older version, but initialized slightly differently: CXD2545Q used
CX(3B2250) whilst CXD2938Q is using CX(3B7250).<br/>

#### CXD2938Q - CX(3Cxxxx) - TzcCoutSelect with New/Changed Extra Bits
The CXD2545Q used two 8bit commands, CX(3C) and CX(3D), for TzcOut selection,
which are now replaced by a single 24bit command, CX(3Cxxxx), and which do
include a new mode related to New SCEx.<br/>
```
  CXD2545Q   CXD2938Q
  CX(3C)     CX(3C0080) TzcCoutSelectHPTZC;\ <--formerly CX(3C)
  -          CX(3C2080) TzcCoutSelectSCEX ;  <--special NewScex mode
  CX(3D)     CX(3C4080) TzcCoutSelectDTZC ;/ <--formerly CX(3D)
```

#### CXD2938Q - CX(8xxxxx) - Disc Mode with New/Changed Extra Bits
Command CX(8xx) has been 12bit wide on CXD2545Q, and is now expanded 24bit
width (with some changed/unknown bits).<br/>
```
  CXD2545Q   CXD2938Q
  CX(8180)   CX(810408) MODE = Audio (CD-DA)
  CX(8120)   CX(812400) MODE = Audio (CD-DA) (manual SPI bus access)
  CX(8980)   CX(890408) MODE = CDROM (Data)
  -          CX(898000) MODE = CDROM (Data) (used on RESET)
```

#### CXD2938Q - CX(9xx000) - Normal/Double Speed with New Extra Bits
Command CX(9xx) has been 12bit wide on CXD2545Q (with bit12=reserved/zero), and
is now expanded 24bit width (with bit12=unknown/one and bit11-0=unknown/zero).<br/>

#### CXD2938Q - CX(Dx0000) and CX(Ex0000) - New Zero Padding
Commands CX(Dx) and CX(Ex) have been 8bit wide on CXD2545Q, and are now
zeropadded to 24bit width, ie. CX(Dx0000) and CX(Ex0000). Unknown if the extra
bits are hiding any extra features. In practice, the CDROM BIOS is always
setting them zero (except in some test commands which are accidently still
using the old 8bit form, resulting in garbage in lower 16bits).<br/>



##   CDROM Internal Commands CX(xx) - Notes
#### Serial Command Transmission (for Signal Processor and Servo Amplifier)
Commands are sent serially LSB first via DATA,CLOK,XLAT pins: DATA+CLOK are
used to send commands to the chip, command execution is then applied by
dragging XLAT low for a moment.<br/>
Commands can be up to 24bits in length, but unused LSBs (the "don't care" bits)
can be omitted; the PSX BIOS clips the length to 8bit/16bit where possible (due
to the LSB-first transfer order, the chip does treat the most recently
transferred bit as MSB=bit23, and there's no need to transfer the LSBs if they
aren't used).<br/>
Aside from being used as command number, the four most recently transferred
bits are also used to select SENS status feedback (for the SENS selection it
doesn't matter if the four bits were terminated by XLAT or not).<br/>

#### Sled Motor / Track Jumps / Tracking
The Sled motor moves the drive head to the current read position. On a Compact
Disc, the term "Track" does normally refer to Audio tracks (songs). But the
drive hardware uses the terms "Track" and "Tracking" for different purposes:<br/>
Tracking appears to refer to moving the Optics via magnets (ie. moving only the
laser/lens, without actually moving the whole sled) (this is done for fine
adjustments, and it seems to happen more or less automatically; emulators can
just return increasing sectors without needing to handle special tracking
commands).<br/>
Track jumps refer to moving the entire Sled, one "track" is equal to one spiral
winding (1.6 micrometers). One winding contains between 9 sectors on innermost
windings, and 22.5 sectors on outermost windings (the PSX cdrom bios is
translating the sector-distance to non-linear track-distance, and emulators
must undo that translation; otherwise the sled doesn't arrive at the intended
location; the cdrom bios will retry seeking a couple of times and eventually
settle down at the desired location - but it will timeout if the sled emulation
is too inaccurate).<br/>
The PSX hardware uses two mechanisms for moving the Sled:<br/>
Command CX(4xxx) Forward/Reverse Track Jump: allows to move the sled by
1..131070 tracks (ie. max 210 millimeters), and the hardware does stop
automatically after reaching the desired distance.<br/>
Command CX(2x) Forward/Reverse Fast Sled: moves the sled continously until it
gets stopped by another command (in this mode, software can watch the COUT
signal, which gets toggled each "N" tracks; whereas "N" can be selected via
Command CX(Bxxxx), which is configured to N=100h in PSX).<br/>
The PSX cdrom bios is issuing another Fast Sled command (in opposite direction)
after Fast Sled commands, emulators must somehow interprete this as "sled
slowdown" (rather than as actually moving the sled in opposite direction, which
could move the sled miles away from the target). For some reason vC1 BIOS is
using a relative short slowdown period, whilst vC2/vC3 are using much longer
slowdown periods (probably related to different SledKickHeight aka
SledKickLevel settings and/or to different Sled Move Voltage settings).<br/>

#### Focus / Gain / Balance
The hardware includes commands for adjusting & measuring
focus/gain/balance. Emulators can just omit that stuff, and can always
signalize good operation (except that one should emulate failures for Disc
Missing; and eventually also for cases like Laser=Off, or Spindle=Stopped).<br/>
Focus does obviously refer to moving the lens up/down. Gain does probably refer
to reflection level/laser intensity. Balance might refer to tracking
adjustments or so.<br/>

Note: for vC2, some CX(38xxxx) values may differ depending on
"set\_mid\_lsb\_to\_140Eh".<br/>
For vC2, CX(Dx) and CX(Ex) should be officially zero-padded to CX(Dx00) and
CX(Ex00), but the vC2 BIOS doesn't do that, it still uses short 8bit form.<br/>
For vC2, CX(Dx) and CX(Ex) should be apparently zero-padded to CX(Dx0000) and
CX(Ex0000), at least, the vC3 BIOS is doing so (except on some test comannds
that do still use the CX(Ex) short form).<br/>

#### Used Sense Values

  sense(38)  SEIN.GAIN      ;vC2: AGOK(AGT/AGF) or XAVEBSY(AVRG) or SSTP(else?)
  sense(40)  XBUSY (low=AutoSeqBusy)
  sense(50)  FOK   (high=FokusOkay)

##   CDROM Internal Coefficients (for CXD2545Q)
The CXD2545Q contains Preset Coefficients in internal ROM, which are copied to
internal Coefficient RAM shortly after Reset. CX(34xxxx) allows to change those
RAM settings, and CX(39xxxx) allows to readout some of those values serially.<br/>
